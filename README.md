# Proppos frontend technical test

Objectives

Test the skills in ReactJS.\
Test the ability of the candidate to develop functionalities defined in a design.\
Test the ability of the candidate to face problems.\
Test how the candidate resolves functionalities that are not designed and how these functionalities affect the user experience.\
Test the ability to create clean code and documentation.\
Is considered as a bonus to develop the challenge without CSS frameworks like bootstrap or material design.

Test description

The objective of the test is to validate the skills of the candidate with the technologies required by the job position and assess how the candidate faces problems. The test consists of two possible challenges, the candidate needs to accomplish a minimum of one challenge.

The challenges

My game page

This challenge is a web application that uses IGDB public API to show data.

Challenge requirements

Follow the design on this link (https://www.figma.com/file/LjvH5ItEQaG0NkavPBAivu/DESIGN_REACT_CHALLENGE?node-id=6%3A0)\
The features that are not designed. The candidate should give full rein to their imagination.\
Create the React application with the following pages:\
Featured games: This shows the list of games with the highest number of followers.\
Most recent games: Shows the most recent games that have been released (The game must have been released on any platform or country)\
Search games: A search bar that allows users to search games by their name.\
Upload the project to a public repository of your choice (Github, GitLab, etc)\
Publish the project live to preview it (Heroku, surge.sh)

Optional requirements

Use webpack instead of bundlers like create-react-app.\
Use Redux to manage the global state of the application\
Test your application with Jest or any test suite.

Any addition to the application is welcome, the IGDB API is bast and flexible, you can add more sections or data to the existing pages if you want.

Countries page: On this page, the user should be able to filter at least one pair of filters simultaneously, the user should be able to add countries to favorites, and stored them in the apollo cache.\
Favorites: On this page, the user should be able to see his favorite countries and remove them from his favorites\
Upload the project to a public repository of your choice (Github, GitLab, etc)\
Publish the project live to preview it (Heroku, surge.sh)\
Optional requirements\
Use webpack instead of bundlers like create-react-app.\
Use apollo cache to store favorites.\

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
